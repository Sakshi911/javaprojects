      out.write("Behavioural disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are by far the most studied childhood disorders that benefit from parent training. Quite commonly these disorders occur comorbidly, which means that one child can show symptoms of more than one disorder (e.g. both ADHD and ODD). It has been shown that these children?s behaviour also improves significantly after their parents have implemented the skills learned at training sessions.<br>\n");
      out.write("Children with autism, eating disorders and anxiety have also been shown to benefit from the changes brought about in parent management as a result of parent training.<br>\n");
      out.write("As any parent would agree the challenges associated with bringing up any child, whether they suffer from a psychological disorder or not, are numerous and at times overwhelming. Parent training helps parents to manage their stress levels and helps them to develop better coping mechanisms, which in turn provides a healthier more controlled home environment.<br>\n");
      out.write("Child and parental behaviour can be described as having a bidirectional relationship, in which one influences the other. If children are hyperactive and defiant, then parents can become stressed and angry. The more stressed and angry parents become, the more the child will act out, and so on. This results in a vicious cycle where both parent and child behaviour become worse and more hostile. Parent training sessions can be very successful in stopping this cycle.</p><br><br>\n");

      out.write("<p style=\"font-size:20px;font-family:Franklin Gothic;color:rgb(0,111,0);\">Parent training is not a ?quick fix? for any situation. Parents are required to attend 75-90 minute sessions once a week for 8-22 weeks depending upon their individual circumstance.<br>\n");
      out.write("While it is ideal that both parents attend the sessions, it is often not possible. It is important to remember that, no matter what the relationship status of the child?s parents, both mothers and fathers individually have been shown to make a difference to their child?s behaviour. So do not be disheartened about the idea if you are a single parent. Perhaps you could bring a friend who is also experiencing a behavioural problem at home.<br>\n");
      out.write("There is also group parent training offered by some clinics, where up to ten families can attend the sessions. In some studies it has been shown that these group training sessions are in fact more effective, as the parents from different families can rely on each other for support, guidance and understanding.<br>\n");
      out.write("Sessions involve role-playing, lecture-style talks by psychologists, discussion and homework. Each session will carry on from the previous with constant revision of the learned skills and information.</p><br><br>\n");

It is not recommended that children attend the sessions.\n");
      out.write("In the sessions the parents will learn:<br>\n");
      out.write("<b>>About their child?s condition:</b> It is very important that parents understand what their child?s behavioural disorder actually is, what the major symptoms are, and what the child may be feeling.<br>\n");
      out.write("<b>>What to expect from their child:</b> Expectations of a child?s development need to be realistic, otherwise the child will feel threatened and may take a ?backwards step? in their learning and behaviour. This may lead to disappointment on the parents? behalf, which will impact on the self-esteem of the child.<br>\n");
      out.write("How to give commands appropriately, both verbally and non-verbally: A firm voice with an appropriate volume and constant eye contact are very important when giving commands.<br>\n");
      out.write("<b>>The importance of praise:</b> Just as important as knowing how to deal with disobedient behaviour is to know how to positively reinforce good behaviour. In order for parents to establish a good relationship with their child, is it imperative that they constantly praise good behaviour and encourage children to engage in activities which they enjoy and are good at. Rewards and incentives are also successful tools for encouraging good behaviour.<br>\n");
      out.write("<b>>How to reprimand appropriately:</b> When a child first acts out, they should be told straight away not to continue that behaviour. This reprimand needs to be firm and serious, but yelling and shouting should not be necessary. If parents yell and shout, their children will too.<br>\n");
      out.write("<b>>When to give warnings and when to take action:</b> Children need to know when they are doing something inappropriate. Therefore it is quite acceptable for parents to give their child a warning. However, one warning is enough. If there are too many warnings given, they will lose meaning.<br>\n");
      out.write("<b>>Timeout:</b> An important focus of PT, especially with children under the age of 10, is timeout. Timeout must be consistent, the same amount of time (usually 1 minute/year of age of child), and must be enforced EVERY time the child acts inappropriately. If this is ten times in one hour, then so be it. If it is not consistent then the child will always ?push the boundaries? to see when they can get away with bad behaviour.<br>\n");
      out.write("These skills are revised continuously through the sessions. Parents are involved in role-playing with the psychologist and are required to continuously practise these skills at home.<br>\n");

      out.write("<b>>Encouragement and praise for good eating and exercising:</b> This is imperative in order to change habits, especially for children over the age of eight. Improving child self-esteem is essential in order to change their dietary patterns. If they believe they can do it, they will. This is largely influenced by parent attitude.<br>\n");
      out.write("Similar techniques exist for under-eating problems (e.g. anorexia nervosa, bulimia). Although these disorders are opposite to over-eating as far as weight is concerned, the general principal is the same. Improved self-esteem will improve eating conditions. Encouraging good eating and being a good role model are the first steps in achieving this.</p>\n");

This training is designed to teach parents how to prepare their child for tasks and challenges they will encounter in their daily environments. In order to achieve this, parents are taught how to identify the interests and strong points of their child. This is mainly done through short and frequent sessions of imaginative play with their child.<br>\n");

For example, they may learn that their child is stimulated more by a farm-type creative play than by cars.

For example, if the child is good at throwing balls but lacks the skill for dressing a barbie, it is more important to concentrate on ball throwing rather than trying to improve the fine motor skill associated with dressing a barbie.<br>\n");
      out.write("<b>>Social:</b> Children are more likely to engage socially when they are participating in activities which they enjoy. Parents are taught to identify these activities and concentrate on them during their one on one session with the child.<br>\n");

Parents are also actively encouraged to involve themselves with the child?s school life. This includes volunteer work, classroom visits, attendance at school meetings and participation in school organisations. The most important interaction that parents should have with the school is communication with the child?s teacher and principal. This way the teachers and parents can work together to assess the child?s development and discuss what areas need to be focussed on, both in the classroom and at home.<br>\n");
      out.write("It is suggested that 25 hours per week of one on one contact is spent with an autistic child. This is not always possible, though, and parents should try to spend as much time as they can with their child, aiming for at least 15 hours per week.</p><br><br>\n");
